I have obtained a blood glucose monitor. The plan is to use it whilst logging all the foods that I eat. Before I do an analysis on that last part, here are the first four days of the data, sliced a few different ways:

## Raw time series

## Time within a day

Surprising amount going on in the middle of the night, here. I think it might be when I sleep on the monitor and restrict blood flow to it.

## Histogram

I think this might make me prediabetic. I have doubts about the accuracy of this meter, though.
