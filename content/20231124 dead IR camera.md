My infiray-go got put in the wash, and then in the dryer. The dryer got hot enough that it broke the rigid flex. Here is what it looked like after my repair efforts:

## Cracked flex
The edge of the flex where it joined the usb module was cracked:

## Actually broken flex:
This is what the edge of the pcb where the flex snapped off looked like:

After sanding it down a bit I got to the ground layer:

A bunch more sanding and careful scraping got the edge of the flex cable exposed:

The flex cable was two layers with a ground plane. I had to peel back the ground plane to be able to connect it to the other side of the PCB:

Then a jig was made to line the two halves up:

The blob on the right is the first blob of flux. That fixed the flex in place, and then I started soldering from the other end. Here the first wire is placed down:
