# Idea
As mentioned [[20220923 blindar prototype notes|before]] because the lidar does not have any notion its pose it makes it difficult to detect the difference between:
 - A spike in distance that is due to the lidar scanning over an obstacle (side view):

- The lidar scanning over a different point in the floor by pitching up with the lidar (top view).

One of these is obviously a problem, and the other isn't. If we knew the pose of the lidar then it would be easy to do this by projecting the points into the world frame.
