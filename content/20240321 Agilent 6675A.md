I bought an Agilent 6675A power supply for $40. 110V 18A supply, tremendous.

I plugged it in, set the voltage to 10V. Got 10V, nice. I changed the voltage to 110V and then got this:

...not so nice. This is the schematic of the above board with what I think blew up crossed out:

...so that's not great. I purchased a replacement MOSFET driver and a not-quite-replacement npn transistor (TIP42C), then reconnected everything and turned it back on. It turns on and I can set the voltage and current, but the front panel says 'Unr' which according to the manual means "unregulated". Further investigation revealed that the input 240V 20A fuse had blown, so I replaced it with some 0.2mm copper wire, which apparently has a fusing current of like 6A.

After turning on the supply it seemed happier. I changed the voltage to 6V and the power supply said it was in constant voltage mode instead of unregulated mode, nice! Then I turned around to grab the multimeter and the fuse wire I put in absolutely _detonated_ with a loud bang. Not a pop. A bang. This is what the surrounding area looked like afterwards:

...That is a little unnerving. I quickly got out the thermal camera after it went pop to try and catch something red handed, but no luck. Rather than put a piece of wire back and try it all again, I instead went back to the FET board above looking for trouble. This time the pnp Q252 driving the low side FET died. Oh and by the way, the schematic is not the schematic for the board that I have. It's for a later revision of the board that uses MOSFET's rather than IGBT's. Taking the pnp transistor out I see it has failed short.

...Looking at the datasheet for the replacement transistor I got I observe that it has a transition frequency of 3MHz, whereas the originals (according to the schematic, anyway) have a transistion frequency of 80MHz. Given that they were driving the top and bottom of a half bridge, the chances of shoot through are approximately 100%.  So I've ordered a full set of replacement pnp's for 3/4 of the price of the entire power supply.
