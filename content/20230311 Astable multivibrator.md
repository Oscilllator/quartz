Following along from [[20230305 verilog knob]] it would seem like a good idea to generate a variable frequency without using the fpga at all. Blindly copying a nice guide [here](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/waveforms/astable.html) I end up with this:

It turns out that the waveform at the gate is actually a bit higher amplitude and nicer:
