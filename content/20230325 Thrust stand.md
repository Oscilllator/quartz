# Goal
I would like to build a drone that has a long flight time, ideally like 1hr. Also it should be small (<500g)
## Tradeoffs
The most efficient propeller is one that is large and spins slowly. The most efficient Motor is one that spins very fast.
These are in tension, and so what you want for a hovering drone is a large propeller with low pitch. 
The practical limit on how low would be the minimum of (propeller tensile strength, increased parasitic drag as result of high tip velocity, flutter and suchlike).
Perhaps it is possible to print and measure some 3d printed propellers. This post is about measuing propellers.

# Hardware
The thrust stand is very simple and looks like this:
