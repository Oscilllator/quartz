I purchased recently one of these
[DYKB 1MHZ-3800MHz RF Digital Programmable RF Attenuator 0-31DB Adjustable Step 1dB PC Software Control FOR Spectrum Analyzer](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256802165268535.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.27.645b1802EMwgHZ&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa&_randl_shipto=US)

Let's take a look at how good it is with the nanoVNA.

Test range: 50kHz-1.5G.
### 5dB

## 10dB

## 20dB

## 30dB

The top line is reference 0dB attenuation going through the attenuator. It's wiggly I think mostly cause I didn't bother to do a proper cal.
here is 0dB through the attenuator vs a sma-sma straight passthrough:
