So the time has come to build a 915MHz oscillator and try and mix stuff in. 
The only piece of equipment that I have that can detect 915MHz stuff is a RTL-SDR software defined radio. It will be hideously slow to sweep out a full spectrum, but should do the job.
Fortunately there is a [great webpage](https://www.qsl.net/va3iul/High_Frequency_VCO_Design_and_Schematics/High_Frequency_VCO_design_and_schematics.pdf) on the topic which has just what I need. To minimise the chances of anything going wrong I will go with the high frequency oscillator that has the same topology as my current one:

Which once it is working we should be able to adjust down to 915MHz no problem. I even have the BFP420 and some SMV123*4* diodes.
This is what the circuit looks like assembled on the [[20221015 FM V3 bringup]] pcb:

I used a 27nH inductor though.
Straight out of the box it oscillates between and  520 and 730MHz! it's only a 500MHz scope but it shows up great nonetheless:

Assuming the signal is within the scopes frequency range that would put the amplitude at about 1.5V, too. I guess this guy really knows what he's doing.
The circuit only has a 730/520 = 1.5:1 tuning ratio though  compared to the claimed >2:1. not sure what the cause of that is. Could well be parasitics, since we are talking about single digit pF here.
Apparently the frequency of oscillation in the above circuit is given by Ï‰2 L = 1/(C2+Cvar)+(1/C3)+(1/C4). So since I want a frequency 50% higher that means I should divide the L by 1.5^2 = 2.25, right?
Swapping out for a 12nH inductor gives a low frequency of 720MHz and a high of something that is north of 1GHz (this is a 2GSa/s scope):

Excellent! Only one problem - I only bought two of those diodes so I can't make another receiver circuit straightaway. To digikey!

#  Mixing
Next step is to do the upconversion. Since it turns out my scope can see 720MHz just fine, let's do it there. The seupt is  the output of the oscillator tuned to 750MHz on the dot sent into an ADE-2ASK+ mixer as the "LO", with the "IF" being a 5MHz sin wave coming from  the function generator (amplitude only 56mV here).
Here is an FFT of before mixing (white) and after mixing (orange):

If we zoom in on the time series we can see the modulation of channel 3:

I don't know what the deal is with the three spikes in the frequency domain. This is outside the proper operating region of the scope so it might just be a measurement thing but if not this is something to worry about I think.

This all looks fairly reasonable, now the question is if it can be downconverted back to the original signal.
