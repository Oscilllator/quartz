I took a picture (when I remembered) of everything that I ate for the two weeks the blood glucose meter lasted. Here are the results:

# Highlights:

There were many occasions where eating something would give a nice big spike how you would expect. But there were many other occasions where eating would apparently do nothing. Not sure why that is.
## Good looking spikes

The obvious, a big bottle of coke:

490g of mince and brown rice, with ~150ml of ginger beer:

Breakfast of yoghurt, fruit, nuts, and weird granola thing. With an orange juice _before_ the solid food:

I specially took data with the orange juice _after_, but the glucose meter didn't record data for that period???

Milk gives a good healthy spike too:

Absolutely lethal banana:

## Mysterious lack of response

This one is a bit weird because I was building an igloo until 2AM, so maybe that's why the response didn't go back down:

Who knows what's going on here. Maybe I just ate lots of snacks and then didn't take pictures or something.

# Overall
The lack of response on many occasions is confusing. Don't have any real explanation for that. I also clearly need to go calibrate the unit against a real blood test, since a mean glucose of 120 is pretty bad, apparently.
