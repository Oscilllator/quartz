20 pin connector. Total width from the start of the first pin to the start of the next is 9.49mm. So a pitch of 0.4745mm. Call it 0.5mm I suppose.</p><p>This is the interface for the communication board, which is <em>not</em> the flex cable above:</p><p><img src="/harrydb.com/Pasted image 20250301110950.png" width=auto></p><p>Powering it up and connecting a suitably padded flex cable between the actual gyro and the controller+psu PCB, the &lsquo;valid&rsquo; bit of the serial output is 0 and the measured rate is also exactly 0.</p><p>The measured laser current however seems to be changing a few times per second from around 23 to 53mA. That seems wack. But, lo! I also found this test point on the fiber gyro board:</p><p><img src="/harrydb.com/Pasted image 20250310200913.png" width=auto></p><p>Note the time axis here. here is a plot of the measured laser current as a function of time:</p><p><img src="/harrydb.com/Pasted image 20250310201051.png" width=auto></p><p>A Clue!</p><p>This is the test point in question:</p><p><img src="/harrydb.com/Pasted image 20250310201754.png" width=auto></p><p>Which is the Vout pin of the

So perhaps then the gyro is going through an initialization routine and can&rsquo;t get out of it?</p><p>Interestingly, some of the test points sweep through 6 values and others through 5.</p><a href=#literature><h2 id=literature><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Literature</h2></a><p>I found the book &ldquo;Design and development of fiber optic gyroscopes&rdquo;.

There are two through hole connectors that I can see on the fiber board, a 5 pin one in a ring, and a weird 2 pin one that seems to have no voltage on it at all (this is in agreement with the below observations on the DAC input being flat, though).</p><p>I had naively assumed that the output of the gyro was like an FMWC lidar; there would be some beat frequency that would be measured.

Kind of weird because when I probe pins 1 and 2 of the chip with the probe AC coupled and zoomed in to 5mv/div, I see basically no change whatsoever on the input. The chip also does not have an internal amplifier, so it&rsquo;s not just that it&rsquo;s too low for the scope to measure.</p><p>So the next step is to take a reading of the digital signals, which will require probing the CLK+SDO lines concurrently.

Of course the beam can be much smaller than that, but even if it&rsquo;s 0.2mm then that&rsquo;s still 0.2deg, which also doesn&rsquo;t seem likely</p><a href=#talking-to-it><h2 id=talking-to-it><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Talking to it</h2></a><p>The DSP-750 has no documentation that suggests you can send it commands. However, the DSP-1760 (a full imu, not just a fiber gyro) includes this command table:</p><p><img src="/harrydb.com/Pasted image 20250315111116.png" width=auto></p><p>So I opened up the arduino serial port and sent a bunch of them. Here is me sending the <code>=config</code> command:</p><p><img src="/harrydb.com/Pasted image 20250315111210.png" width=auto></p><p>Looks like it&rsquo;s just being ignored. The manual says this:</p><p><img src="/harrydb.com/Pasted image 20250315112847.png" width=auto></p><a href=#second-unit-second-life><h2 id=second-unit-second-life><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Second unit, second life</h2></a><p>One of the things that most disturbs me about the gyros is that the voltage output of the photodiode is basically zero always. I saw light earlier coming out of the laser and the photodiode has an internal amplfier in it, so it&rsquo;s definitely possible for it to be busted.</p><p>For lack of anything else to do I plugged in the second unit to see if there was anything different. And there is! here is the output from the second one:</p><p>Zoomed out in time, showing the different laser currents:</p><p><img src="/harrydb.com/Pasted image 20250315120442.png" width=auto></p><p>Zoomed in and AC coupled to the highest current:</p><p><img src="/harrydb.com/Pasted image 20250315120258.png" width=auto></p><p>Recall that the PCB itself actually has an AC coupled output to the photodiode:</p><p><img src="/harrydb.com/Pasted image 20250315120601.png" width=auto></p><p>So this is all tying together and fits in to what I thought before: The controller board is stepping through a bunch of laser currents until it finds a receive signal. However it never finishes its initialization. The fact that it found a signal on the last possible value of laser current suggests that something is out of wack and it can&rsquo;t step far enough.</p><p>From the above section on the angular tolerance of the photodiode I stuck a calibrated spacer made of a 32awg wire insulation into the gap between the PCB and the gyro case. And now it works! I can integrate it over time no problem. It seems to be mostly measuring the earths rotation rate as expected. It&rsquo;s also incredibly sensitive as expected, jumping up and down on my concrete slab floor gives a loud and clear signal. Pushing sideways on the desk gives an oscillation that takes a few seconds to die away.</p><a href=#the-second-gyro><h2 id=the-second-gyro><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The second gyro</h2></a><p>The second gyro was not amenable to the same treatment as the first, the output of the amplifier seems stuck at -3.8V and doesn&rsquo;t change with the laser current. Now to do a comparison of the voltages. This should be a lot easier now there is one that&rsquo;s working.</p><p><img src="/harrydb.com/Pasted image 20250315202842.png" width=auto></p><p>1: -4.6V
2: 4.6V
3: 0V
4: 0V
5: -4.6V</p><p>So it looks like it&rsquo;s just measuring 0V. It occurs to me that when I measured the laser light above I did so on the unit I was not using at the time, which was the one that turned out to work. Let&rsquo;s do the same measurement on this one, for which no light is being measured. I checked the TIA die inside the photodiode by the way, and didn&rsquo;t notice anything frazzled.</p><a href=#two-different-hardware-revisions><h3 id=two-different-hardware-revisions><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Two different hardware revisions:</h3></a><p>This is what the one that works looks like:</p><p><img src="/harrydb.com/Pasted image 20250315205705.png" width=auto></p><p>And this is what the one that doesn&rsquo;t looks like:</p><p><img src="/harrydb.com/Pasted image 20250315205924.png" width=auto></p><p>The broken ones mirror isn&rsquo;t bolted down and is flapping in the breeze! And there isn&rsquo;t even a way to bolt it down either! This makes no sense at all. In addition to being a different hardware revision this one has also been assembled differently, the fiber for this one passes over the others and has a tendency to pop out of the casing. The previous one had the fiber coming out of the mirror pass under some others and was much better controlled. For posterity, the &lsquo;A&rsquo; gyro is the one that works.</p><a href=#light-output><h3 id=light-output><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Light output</h3></a><p>The gyro that works has light clearly coming out of the mirror. The one that doesn&rsquo;t, doesn&rsquo;t. I can see that there is light coming out of the laser as it leaks out the bottom of the package. however there is absolutely zilch coming out of all other areas. I think this is the root cause of the issue this particular gyro has. Light is clearly coming out of the laser, and not coming out of the fiber that&rsquo;s supposed to go to the photodiode. Not much I can do about that.</p><p>Still though, the fact that the location of the mirror is so incredibly poorly constrained, and the small shifting of the PCB from the previous gyro fixing it entirely means that I&rsquo;m not 100% satisfied.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=harrydb.com// data-ctx="20250301 Fiber gyro.md" data-src=/ class=internal-link>Harry dB notes</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=/harrydb.com/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Harry dB using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, Â© 2025</p><ul><li><a href=harrydb.com/>Home</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
