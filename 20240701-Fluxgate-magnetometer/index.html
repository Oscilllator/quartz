<a href=https://www.worldradiohistory.com/UK/Wireless-World/90s/Wireless-World-1991-09.pdf rel=noopener>Wireless world magazine, 1991</a>. I didn&rsquo;t really follow the guide but if you read it you&rsquo;ll get the general idea.</p><a href=#version-1><h1 id=version-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Version 1</h1></a><p>The idea of winding a toroid sounded too hard to me so I made two separate linear coils and connected them with some magic magnetic tape. Here are the two windings before I added the sense coil:</p><p><img src="/quartz/Pasted image 20240701184124.png" width=auto></p><p>And here is what it looks like &ldquo;fully assembled&rdquo;:</p><p><img src="/quartz/Pasted image 20240701184432.png" width=auto></p><p>I drove it straight out of the signal generator and amazingly it worked out of the box. It&rsquo;s quite sensitive and was able to detect my twiddling of a bar magnet like 5 meters away!
This is quite significant as it represents the first time I have ever built an electronic device and had it (1) work on the first try and (2) had it be more sensitive than expected. I suppose it makes sense now how they were able to get them good enough in WWII to detect submarines from a plane.</p><p>The limit on the detection though was the 0 level. Even when I aligned the sensor such that it was normal to the ambient magnetic field, there was still quite a large signal measured on the scope. Reading around a bit (&ldquo;Magnetic sensors and magnetometers&rdquo; is a sensible book) it seems that one of the main reasons to use a toroid is that it evens out the variations in manufacturing that are the result of these residual errors.</p><p>Since the magnetometers measurement comes from the asymmetry in how each side of the device magnetises/demagnetises, it makes sense that this would be worth switching the design.</p><a href=#version-2><h1 id=version-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Version 2</h1></a><p>So, time to suck it up and wind a toroid. The book also mentioned that one way to get low variation in your wound toroid is to wind it such that there windings are just touching along the inner race, since then the wire diameter is what sets the pitch. Good advice but that results in far more windings than is required in practice and I realised just after I started winding that I could have printed some notches in my 3D print which would have also defined the winding spacing and not required me to wind 7m of wire through a 35mmID toroid. Oh well.</p><a href=#toroid-construction><h3 id=toroid-construction><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Toroid construction</h3></a><p>Here is the inside of the toroid. I put two strips of metal ~2.75mm wide (hand cut with scissors, naturally) into the toroid which was sized to just fit the length of the strip.
<img src="/quartz/Pasted image 20240701184920.png" width=auto></p><p>And here it is all wound together:</p><p><img src="/quartz/Pasted image 20240701185051.png" width=auto></p><p>&mldr;Not exactly a precision device, is it? But the 3d printed outer sense coil winding is critical. By rotating the inner toroid with respect to the outer one, I can move it to a point that minimizes the measurement when the sensor is perpendicular to the earths field. This makes quite a bit of difference.</p><a href=#zero-field><h3 id=zero-field><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Zero field</h3></a><p>Here is the output of the sensor, showing the maximum, minimum, and zero measurements achievable here on earth:</p><p><img src="/quartz/Pasted image 20240701185559.png" width=auto></p><p>So that&rsquo;s (3.2 - -2.5) / 55e-6 = 100mV/uT. That&rsquo;s 103kV/tesla, which sounds good. That&rsquo;s also 10000 gamma/volt, and the above magazine article calibrates it to a maximum of 100 gamma/volt, or 100x more sensitive.</p><a href=#magazine-schematic><h3 id=magazine-schematic><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Magazine schematic:</h3></a><p><img src="/quartz/Pasted image 20240701190306.png" width=auto></p><p><img src="/quartz/Pasted image 20240701190311.png" width=auto></p><p><img src="/quartz/Pasted image 20240701190324.png" width=auto></p><a href=#gating-and-filtering><h2 id=gating-and-filtering><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Gating and filtering</h2></a><p>Here&rsquo;s an idea: The signal has 0 DC level. So what we really want to do here is rectify it. But, the signal is small. So instead we can just grab the section of the signal that has the spike in it, and average around that!</p><p>Like this:</p><p><img src="/quartz/Pasted image 20240701190754.png" width=auto></p><p>ta-da! Done using an SI2302 analog switch, aka a mosfet as recommended by the Art of Electronics:</p><p><img src="/quartz/Pasted image 20240701190843.png" width=auto></p><p>It introduces a huge amount of charge injection but I&rsquo;m going to wave my hands and say it&rsquo;s fine since the + and - section average to 0 anyway. Filtering this chopped signal and zooming into the noise floor, we get:</p><p><img src="/quartz/Pasted image 20240701193547.png" width=auto></p><p>Which sure does look an awful lot like mains. So I guess we have reached the noise floor of this particular environment.</p><a href=#alternative-to-gating-and-filtering><h2 id=alternative-to-gating-and-filtering><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Alternative to gating and filtering</h2></a><p>I got annoyed at the above gating because of the charge injection that I couldn&rsquo;t get rid of. I tried adding a complementary pmos and when that didn&rsquo;t work gave up. Instead, how about rectifying the signal? It would need to be amplified first but that&rsquo;s OK as my boards with a bunch of amplifiers came in.</p><p>Here one is:</p><a href=#amplifier><h3 id=amplifier><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Amplifier</h3></a><p><img src="/quartz/Pasted image 20240702204618.png" width=auto></p><p>It has a 10MHz gain bandwidth product (TP2311) so that looks about right.</p><p><img src="/quartz/Pasted image 20240702212131.png" width=auto></p><p>here is what the magnetometer looks like detecting a 1KHz sine wave:</p><p><img src="/quartz/Pasted image 20240702212010.png" width=auto></p><p>The magnetometer is being driven at 70kHz.</p><a href=#bandpass-filter><h3 id=bandpass-filter><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Bandpass filter</h3></a><p><img src="/quartz/Pasted image 20240702214700.png" width=auto></p><p><img src="/quartz/Pasted image 20240702214711.png" width=auto></p><p>&mldr;Not great.</p><a href=#using-magnetometer-to-sense-11khz-magnetic-field><h2 id=using-magnetometer-to-sense-11khz-magnetic-field><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Using magnetometer to sense 11kHz magnetic field.</h2></a><p>This is starting to get a bit tricky. I angled the magnetometer such that it was not receiving much magnetic field. Then I strapped a coil to it, and excited the coil at 11kHz (to fit inside the above bandpass later).</p><p>Setup:
<img src="/quartz/Pasted image 20240703082710.png" width=auto></p><p>There are three states here in the FFT plot:</p><ol><li>No excitation, minimum magnetic field. This resulted in a peak at basically only 50kHz</li><li>No excitation, max magnetic field. Strong peaks at 100 and 200kHz appear in proportion to the strength of the field</li><li>Exciting with external field. Base 11kHz modulation appears, but there is a much stronger peak at 100kHz +/- 11kHz. This is also in direct proportion to the volts going into the coil, and is also independent of the external magnetic field.
<img src="/quartz/Pasted image 20240703081957.png" width=auto></li></ol><p>I had initially thought here that the strongest signal would show up at the base excitation freqency:
<img src="/quartz/Pasted image 20240703082409.png" width=auto></p><p>But from the above FFT it appears that this is not actually the case.</p><a href=#measuring-technique-pivot><h2 id=measuring-technique-pivot><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Measuring technique pivot.</h2></a><p>I gave up on all of the above amplifiers and filters, I do not think they are necessary. Instead, I can just pull 100e6 samples off the scope and do an FFT to measure the power in the bands I care about directly. I think that&rsquo;s a much better technique.</p><a href=#more-current><h2 id=more-current><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>More current</h2></a><p>I was barely receiving any signal at all from my magnetometer from my coil and I figure that was because I was driving it from my waveform generator rather than from a proper driver. So I resoldered the H bridge from <a href=/quartz/20240522-Plasma-toroid-4-decoupling rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/20240522-Plasma-toroid-4-decoupling>the plasma toroid project</a> and that pushed plenty of amps into the system. So many that I needed to put 3 5W 10R resistors in parallel so as not to hit the undervoltage lockout of the LMG chip. But after that it was fine.</p><a href=#measuring-the-current><h2 id=measuring-the-current><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Measuring the current</h2></a><p>I can&rsquo;t look at the high side of the coil and use the 50R impedance of the AWG to calculate the current going into this thing any more, since this is my setup now:</p><p><img src="/quartz/Pasted image 20240704165355.png" width=auto></p><p>So I need another way to measure the current. I don&rsquo;t have any current sense resistors (4 1.1R 0603 resistors in parallel blew up real quick) but I do have a stainless steel PCB stencil, so I chopped some of that and used it as a current sense resistor:</p><p><img src="/quartz/Pasted image 20240704165623.png" width=auto></p><p>You may be wondering how one solders to stainless steel. It is in fact trivial with the tremendous flux that I was gifted. Naturally the label corroded off quite quickly and so I don&rsquo;t know what brand it is precisely, but it is inside a secondary containment container with &ldquo;STAY BRITE&rdquo; on it.</p><p>Anyway the above current sense resistor is about 0.286 Ohms apparently.</p><p>This will be required later as the coil itself has some frequency response and so you can&rsquo;t just assume the applied voltage translates to a current directly.</p><a href=#analog-current><h2 id=analog-current><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analog current</h2></a><p>Now I have things set up reasonably well I need to generate a signal at many different frequencies from my coil and measure it with the fluxgate magnetometer to prove this whole thing out. But the output of the above H bridge is always a square wave and so there will be all kinds of harmonics all over the place. I don&rsquo;t want to deal with that, I want to measure one and only one frequency at a time!</p><p>No problem though, I will use the inductor in my coil like a motor winding and drive it like a BLDC sin drive!

This results in the following current plot:</p><p><img src="/quartz/Pasted image 20240704170558.png" width=auto></p><p>Which doesn&rsquo;t look too bad. It didn&rsquo;t replicate the low end very well so I had to do the <code>sin = sin*0.8 + 0.2</code> above. I also had to make a tradeoff with the waveform output sample rate vs number of samples in the AWG sent to the scope, since the AWG uses the same csv file (it only takes csv files over usb stick) and just plays it back faster or slower. So above a certain waveform repetition rate it goes over the AWG sample rate and the whole thing falls apart. I could transfer a new csv file per frequency but pls, that ain&rsquo;t gonna happen. The above waveform has 8192 samples and that allows it to go between 1 and 15kHz.</p><p>Now we are ready to make some measurements!</p><a href=#measurement-setup><h1 id=measurement-setup><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Measurement setup</h1></a><p>The measurement setup looks like this:</p><p><img src="/quartz/Pasted image 20240704172158.png" width=auto></p><p>The idea here is that the two coils on either side are wound with the opposite circularity coil, and then placed in parallel. Per <a href=/quartz/20240529-Metal-detection#one-positive-one-negative rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/20240529-Metal-detection>my previous simulations</a> (and common sense) this means that there is a null in the middle where the magnetometer can be placed. The idea here is that it is similar to the double D coil setup that many other metal detectors use. The magnetometer is placed so that it is sensitive to fields in the vertical direction. There is a significant earth component in that direction too, but according to the above FFT measurements this should not affect things.</p><p>The magnetometer is hot glued to a mug so I can slide it around and get it into the right position. I do this in the time domain by just lookint at the scope and adjusting things so the persistence view shows that the amplitude is no longer being modulated. Interestingly it is not possible to zero out the field when the magnetometer is rotated 90 degrees so the donut is facing more towards the camera in the above pic (but is still vertical). I guess it&rsquo;s just too wide and either side of the toroid is affected differently.</p><a href=#test-objects><h2 id=test-objects><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Test objects</h2></a><p><img src="/quartz/Pasted image 20240704172732.png" width=auto></p><p>Here are the test objects with which to make measurements. You will notice they are not exactly subtle targets. This setup is very insensitive. The point here though is to see how things <em>change</em> over frequency, not the absolute level. I shall wave my hands and say that the setup is poorly optimised overall and surely if I built it for real I could make it much more sensitive.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/quartz// data-ctx="20240701 Fluxgate magnetometer.md" data-src=/ class=internal-link>Harry dB notes</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://Oscilllator.github.io/quartz/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Harry dB using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2024</p><ul><li><a href=https://Oscilllator.github.io/quartz/>Home</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
